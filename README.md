### Common Issues

Rendering issues with the webpage you are trying to view. Android applications use a component to render webpages, it's called the WebView component. WebView is not the same as Google Chrome app, it does not render the pages the same. The biggest issue is that your version of WebView is not capable of rendering the webpage you are trying to view. The only way possible to fix this issue is to update the WebView component (from Google Play Store), use a different webpage, or update your device OS.
